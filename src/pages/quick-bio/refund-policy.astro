              You may request a refund within 3 days of your annual Pro purchase
              or Pro renewal.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your request is received after that 3-day window, the charge is
              non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              To request a refund, simply include the following in a message to
              our support team:
            </p>
            <p>
              Email address associated with your <span
                class='font-semibold text-blue-900'>bio.quicklabs.in</span
              > page
            </p>
            <p>
              Link to your bio.quicklabs.in page <span
                class='font-semibold text-blue-900'
                >(bio.quicklabs.in/yourusername)</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Date of purchase or renewal (if you have a screenshot of the
              receipt, even better!)
            </p>
            <p>The word "REFUND" in the body of your email</p>
            <p>
              If you are eligible for a refund, your request will be evaluated
              and granted within 30 days.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you do not qualify for a refund because you contacted us beyond
              3 days of the charge, we'd recommend canceling your account so
              that it does not automatically renew again. You'll still have
              access to your Pro features until the end of your billing cycle.
